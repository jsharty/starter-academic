abstract: This chapter describes how to work with special populations involved with the child welfare system (e.g., youth in care; children with disabilities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer/questioning [LGBTQ] youth; immigrant or refugee children) to ensure professionals work collaboratively alongside them to ensure their voice is heard and, that as practitioners, child welfare professionals are providing optimal services to ensure child and family well-being. The chapter also discusses best practices when working with siblings and youth experiencing human and sex trafficking.
