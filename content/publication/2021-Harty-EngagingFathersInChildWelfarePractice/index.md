abstract: This chapter discusses the importance of child and family engagement in child welfare practice as well as describes key skills in engaging and interviewing the various parties involved at various stages of a case. Effective strategies for developing and maintaining appropriate and culturally grounded relationships with children and their families are discussed, as well as ways to work with parents/guardians to provide, monitor, and support services. The chapter also discusses various models for engaging families such as family group decision-making (FGDM), parent cafes, and child and family teams (CFTs) and how to work closely with various professionals, family, and caregivers involved with the case (e.g., school personnel, medical and behavioral health professionals, and law enforcement). The chapter highlights strategies for working with families who experience mental health challenges and substance abuse and other issues as they relate to child welfare system involvement.
