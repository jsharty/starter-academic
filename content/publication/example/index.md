abstract: For Wave 4 of the CalYOUTH Study, researchers surveyed 622
  23-year-olds. This study follows up on surveys of the same young people when
  they were approaching the age of majority in Californiaâ€™s foster care system
  at age 17 and again when they were 19 and 21 years old. Similar to the
  previous interview waves, the study collected data on a wide range of youth
  outcomes in in areas such as physical and mental health, education and
  employment, and relationships and families.
